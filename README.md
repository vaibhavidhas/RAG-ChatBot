## **RAG Chatbot: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for PDF-Based QA**  
This project is an interactive chatbot built with **Streamlit** that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer user queries based on the content of a collection of PDF documents. It supports both **digital PDFs and scanned documents** using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**, and leverages **FAISS** for vector similarity search and **Ollama** for running local LLMs and embeddings.

## 🔍 **Key Features**

### **PDF Parsing**  
Automatically distinguishes between digital and scanned PDFs.

- **Digital PDFs**: Uses **PyPDF2** to extract text.  
- **Scanned PDFs**: Uses **pdf2image + pytesseract** to perform OCR.

### **Chunking and Embedding**  
- Text is split into manageable chunks using **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**.  
- Chunks are embedded using **OllamaEmbeddings** with **nomic-embed-text**.

### **Vector Search with FAISS**  
- **FAISS** is used to store and retrieve relevant text chunks based on semantic similarity to the user query.

### **Conversational QA Chain**  
- Uses **LangChain's QA chain** with a custom prompt to generate natural language responses.  
- **LLM used**: `gemma:2b` via **Ollama**.

### **Interactive UI with Streamlit**  
- Allows users to submit a query and view chat history.  
- One-click processing of documents via a **"Submit & Process"** button.

## 💬 **Workflow Overview**

### **User clicks "Submit & Process"**:
- All PDFs in the specified folder are parsed.
- Text is extracted, chunked, embedded, and stored in a **FAISS index**.

### **User asks a question**:
- The **FAISS index** retrieves the top relevant chunks.
- These chunks are fed into the **LLM** with the user’s question.
- The chatbot responds with a generated answer.

**Chat History** is maintained for better UX and conversation tracking.
